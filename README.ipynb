    "#   Template inheritence\n",
    "# when building a website, you want elements to be repeated from page to page. Rather than continually rewriting these elements, you can write a base template containing the repeated elements, and then have each page inherit from this base template\n",

    "# this tag pulls everything from base.html and allows index.html to define the what goes in the content block\n",
    "# we define the content block with a {% block %} tag. Everything we arent inheriting goes inside the content block here, and to indicate we're finished, the end with an {% end content %} tag\n",
    "# using inheritance like this means it's easier to build and modify pages\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Topics page\n",
    "# now we have an efficient approach for building pages,  we can focus on building the next 2 pages...\n",
    "# First we defint the URL for the topics page. Its a good ide to use a simple URL that reflects the information shown on the page, in this case, 'topics' will do.\n",
    "# to add this URL to our project, we go to our urls.py file in <appname>, and add a path in 'urlpatterns' as we did before:\n",

    "# the topics function needs to get some data from the database and send it to the template\n",
    "# so we go into views.py to define our 'topics' function:\n",

    "# - def topics(request):\n",
    "# -     \"\"\"Show all topics\"\"\"\n",

    "# -     context = {'topics' : topics}\n",
    "# -     return render(request, 'learning_logs/topics.html', context)\n",
    "\n",
    "# first, we import our class Topic from models\n",
    "# the topics function needs a parameter, the request object Django recieved (the URL)\n",
    "# next, we query the databse by asking for the Topic objects, sorted by the 'date_added' attribute, we store the resulting queryset in 'topics'\n",
    "# next, we define a 'context' we'll send to the template, this is a dictionary in which keys are names we'll use in the template to access the data and the values are the data we sent to the template\n",
    "# when building the page, we pass the context variable to the render function as well as the request object and the path to the template.\n",
    "# now, we can build the template\n",
    "# create a new template for the topics page in the templates/<appname> folder called topics.html with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#  -{% extends \"learning_logs/base.html\" %}\n",
    "# - {% block content %}\n",
    "# -     <p>Topics</p>\n",
    "# -     <ul>\n",
    "# -         {% for topic in topics %}\n",
    "# -             <li>{{ topic }}</li>\n",
    "# -         {% empty %}\n",
    "# -             <li>No topics have been added yet.</li>\n",
    "# -         {% endfor %}\n",
    "# -     </ul>\n",
    "# - {% endblock content %}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Firt we inherit from base.html\n",
    "# then open with a content block\n",
    "# write the word 'topics'\n",
    "# start an unordered list marked by <ul>, and close it when we're done\n",
    "# then we have another template tag, {% for topic in topics %}, which is equibalent to a for loop, looping through each topic from the contect dictionary\n",
    "# in html, the for loop is ended with a {% endfor %}\n",
    "# inside the for loop, we turn each topic into an item in the bulleted list. To print the vairbale in a template, we wrap the variable name in double braces\n",
    "# here, the code  {{topic}} will be replaces by the value of topic on each pass through the loop\n",
    "then we use the {% empty %} template tag to tell Django what to do if there are no items in the list, prompting a message informing the user there are to topics in the topic list\n",
    "# the last 3 lines end our for loop, list, and content block.\n",
    "# we can also modify the base template to include a link to the topics page as follows\n",

    "# we will also modify the topics page so each item in the list links to its corresponding page\n",
    "\n",
    "#   topic URL pattern\n",
    "# the topic URL patter is a different that the others so far, as it will use the topics id attribute to indicate which topic (and in turn, which page) is requested\n",
    "# for example, if topicid = 1, the topic with id=1's template will be rendered, and same any value of topic.id\n",
    "# the URL will be localhost:8000/topic/1, localhost:8000.topic/2 ect...\n",
    "# heres how we write the patter to match this URL in urls.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# -     # Detail page for a single topic\n",
    "# -     path('topics/<int:topic_id>/', views.topic, name='topic')\n",
    "\n",
    "# here, we use the same beginning of the string for the URL pattern, with <int:topic_id>, which matches an integer between 2 forward slashes and stores in integer value in an argument called 'topic_id'\n",
    "# in the angle brackets, we can delcare the type of variable to expect (int in this case), and provide a name for the value in the URL, topic_id.\n",
    "# when Django find a URL which matches this pattern, it calls the view function topic() with the value stored in topic_id as an agrument.\n",
    "# we'll use the value of topic_id to get the correct topic inside the function.\n",
    "# lets now define the Topic function inside view:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - def topic(request, topic_id):\n",
    "# -     \"\"\"Show a single topic and all its entries\"\"\"\n",
    "# -     topic = Topic.objects.get(id = topic_id)\n",
    "# -     entries = topic.entry_set.order_by('-date_added')\n",
    "# -     context = {'topic' : topic, 'entries' : entries}\n",
    "# -     return render(request, 'learning_logs/topic.html', context)\n",
    "\n",
    "# in this function, we require a parameter other than the request object. This fcuntion accepts the value captures by <int: topic_id> and stores it in topic_id\n",
    "# we use the get() method to reciece the topic (like in the Django shell), and use the agrument id = topic_id so we fetch the correct topic object\n",
    "# then we get the entries associated with this topic and order them according to their 'date_Added' attribute, with the minus sign before sorting them in reverse order, displaying the most recent entries first\n",
    "# we store the topic and antries in the contect dictionary, and send context to the template topic.html\n",
    "# (NOTE) the topic =, and entries = , lines are called queries, as they query the datavase for specific information. Its good practise to try these commands in the django shell first to see if they give you back what you want within the quick feedback loop of the shell\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Topic template\n",
    "# the topic template needs to display the name of the topic and the entries, we also need to inform the user if no entires have been made yet for this topic\n",

    "# then display 'entries: ' and beind a list, and dcleare s for loop - for entry in entries\n",
    "# then in double brackets, access the 'date_added' attribute. Here, the | symbol represents a template filter, a function that modifies the value in a template variable.\n",
    "# The filter 'date:'M d, Y H:i'' displays timestamps in the format 'January 1, 2015, 23:00'\n",
    "# the next line displays the text attribute of the entry, with the '|linebreaks' filter formatting the linebreaks and paragraphs of the string into html code which copies the formnatting.\n",
    "# This ensures newlines and new paragraphs are displayed correctly\n",
    "# (eg. the string \"Hello\\nWorld\") is formatted to <p>hello<br?World<p>, keeping the format in a way html can read\n",
    "# then we have the 'empty' case, if no entries are made, and then end the list, enf the for loop, end the outer list, and end the content block\n",
