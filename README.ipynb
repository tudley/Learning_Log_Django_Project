    "#   Template inheritence\n",
    "# when building a website, you want elements to be repeated from page to page. Rather than continually rewriting these elements, you can write a base template containing the repeated elements, and then have each page inherit from this base template\n",

    "# this tag pulls everything from base.html and allows index.html to define the what goes in the content block\n",
    "# we define the content block with a {% block %} tag. Everything we arent inheriting goes inside the content block here, and to indicate we're finished, the end with an {% end content %} tag\n",
    "# using inheritance like this means it's easier to build and modify pages\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Topics page\n",
    "# now we have an efficient approach for building pages,  we can focus on building the next 2 pages...\n",
    "# First we defint the URL for the topics page. Its a good ide to use a simple URL that reflects the information shown on the page, in this case, 'topics' will do.\n",
    "# to add this URL to our project, we go to our urls.py file in <appname>, and add a path in 'urlpatterns' as we did before:\n",

    "# when building the page, we pass the context variable to the render function as well as the request object and the path to the template.\n",
